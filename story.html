                            Louise and Andrew met in 2009 during senior year of high school, during an Intro to Photography class. Students were assigned a project that required them to shoot architectural buildings throughout San Francisco. One afternoon, they ran into each other on the street - they were photographing the same building, just from different vantage points! - and decided to shoot together. The afternoon turned to evening and ended with ice cream, where they talked until the shop closed. And the rest, as they say, is history.

                            In November, after dinner at Little Star (where they had their first "real" date!), Andrew surprised Louise by proposing in Buena Vista Park, where they often take their dog Luna for walks.

                            They're so excited to start the next phase of their lives together and can't wait to celebrate with you in August!
