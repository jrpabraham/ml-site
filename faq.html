                    <h1>Frequently Asked</h1>

                    <div class="text">

                        <h3>What is the dress code?</h3>

                            <p>The dress code for our event is formal. Ladies should wear a floor-length evening gown or your most dressy cocktail dress. Gentlemen should wear a suit with a tie or bow tie. Please reserve green for our bridal party.</p>

                        <h3>Can I bring a plus one?</h3>

                            <p>Due to limited space, we can only accommodate those guests formally invited on your wedding invitation. If you received an invitation for a plus one, they would be listed under your name when you RSVP.</p>

                        <h3>Can I bring children?</h3>

                            <p>We love your little ones! Unfortunately, due to our limited space, we respectfully request you only bring children included in the invitation.</p>

                        <h3>How long does it take to get from the church to the reception?</h3>

                            <p>Driving from the church to reception should take 35 to 45 minutes without traffic.</p>

                        <h3>Where can I park?</h3>

                            <p>The church has plenty of parking in its attached parking lot. For the reception, please park at the <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/LFSLLbuCcPczqDXD8">Niles Canyon Railway Museum</a>, located across the street from the venue. There will be parking attendants available to direct you to the parking area.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Where do you recommend overnight guests stay?</h3>

                            <p>We have chosen not to reserve a hotel block. However, there are plenty of hotels in the nearby Pleasanton area. Our recommendation is the <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/8fuf3ru3">Pleasanton Marriott</a>, which is where we will be staying.</p>

                        <h3>Will there be vegetarian/vegan options during the reception?</h3>

                            <p>The entrees on our menu consist primarily of meat and seafood. However, if you have any specific dietary restrictions, please notify us by email as soon as possible so we can ensure we have appropriate options available.</p>

                        <h3>I have other questions, how do I contact you?</h3>

                            <p>Please send us an e-mail at <a class="external" target="_blank" href="mailto:markloveslea@gmail.com">markloveslea@gmail.com</a>. We look forward to having you as part of our special day.</p>
